    <h3>Bài đọc 1</h3>
    <p>This familiar theme will occur in all seven sections of the TOEIC test. It is generally       about office situations such as meetings, conferences, office equipment, policies and       procedures and is related directly to both the Personnel and Purchasing themes (see         'things in the office' in the Purchasing section).<br>
        In the office, situations will be about all kinds of meetings, memos, letters, faxes, emails, departments, all kinds of equipment that has to be looked after such as photocopiers, faxmachines, computers, air conditioners, telephones. It is helpful to understand collocations such as'to hold a meeting;'to downsize a department; or idiomatic/slang expressions such as'to sack someone', 'to fire someone' or 'show someone the door' or le t someone go' all of which mean to terminate (end) someone's employment. To repeat an earlier point, single words and their synonyms are not enough to do well on the TOEIC test, this is particularly the case in conversations of an informal nature where the chance of hearing 'common'or idiomatic language increases. The office theme also uses verbal announcements and written memos to communicate important news to the employees, these would tend to be more formal and thus less difficult to comprehend than face-to-face conversations.</p>
